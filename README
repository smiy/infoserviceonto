This is the Info Service Ontology, which intension it is to model the description and rating concepts of an information service[1]. 
Please feel free to contribute to this project, it may helps you to find your information service of choice for your specific concern.
Furthermore, don't hesitate to create another Info Service Quality Ontology with your own information quality description concepts. 
You are welcome! 
Last but not least, every information service rating agency is welcome to add its own information service ratings to existing information
services and to expand the stack of information service descriptions.

You can find further descriptions and announcements re. Info Service Ontology related things on its blog[2]. If you have any questions re.
the usage of the Info Service Ontology or new proposals for its development, please make use of the Info Service Ontology mailing list[3].

You can find graphics, which illustrates the concepts and relations of the Info Service Ontology in the sub folder 'gfx'. Example code is
included into the sub folder 'examples'. Finally, the ontology specification is located at 'rdf', where you can also find a 'ChangeLog'
and a 'TODO' list. Currently, the ontology specification is available in 'text/n3' and 'rdf/xml'. Feel free to add other representation
formats.

Cheers,

Bob
